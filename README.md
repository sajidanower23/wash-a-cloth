# Description

A script that is meant to be run as a cron job.

Based on the weather forecast obtained from the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5),
the script should send you an email letting you know if it's a bad idea to wash your clothes today.

## TODO

 - [ ] Actually write the script
 - [ ] Automate the process of making this a cron job
 - [ ] Make an approximated guess (based on the sunlight of that location) on how long it may take someone to dry their clothes
